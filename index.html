					<h3>Our Project</h3>
					<p>
						Our project is building a gaming pc. We started this project out of class. We directly begin to dream how it will look and preform. We wanted a fast high-end desktop. But unfortunately it was out of our range.

					<h3>Testing</h3>
					<p>
						When it was assembled is was just a matter of testing. After some strugeling with the graphics card he seems to work fine. But when we start gaming, we got way to low FPS. When we saw how he preforms it seems like he used only one core. We sented some e-mails to Intel. Posted our questions one LinusTechTips. Eventialy we found it by ourselfs, we disabled one core and all the others took it over. Now we had multiple cores but there was still one who was bottlenecking us. We decided to buy a new one on ebay. And...

					<h3>Coding</h3>
					<p>
						We wanted to share how we started at this project and how to put it all together. Making a website looked a very nice way to help people who want to do the same, but do not now where or how to start. We have a bit of experience with programming. So we decided to program it by ourselfs. We improved not only our soldering skills but also our programming skills. The coding itself doesn't took very long but the learning process took a while. But we are happy with the result so it's worth the effort.

					<h3>Decisions</h3>
					<p>
						We had to make some very difficult decisions, for example do we choose an Intel processor or an AMD. Intel has more quantity, but you see it at the price. AMD has more cores but is less faster and a bit cheaper. This chois changed the whole project, because we had to choose the motherboard and ram based on the procerssor.
