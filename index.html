					<h3>Our Project</h3>
					<p>
						Building a gaming pc is something that most kids these times draem of. So after grabbing ourself some secondhand parts we came up with a payable, but still high performing gaming pc. We started this project out of class. We directly begin to dream how it will look and preform. Real life was much harder. Working with spare parts always birngs its falws. After we started to built the pc we noticed several things that were missing, mallfunctioning, giving errors and hardware that simply wasn't compatible. We wanted a fast high-end desktop. But unfortunately it was out of our range.

					<h3>Testing</h3>
					<p>
						When we finally assembled all the parts, we ran into a couple of issues. One of those was that none of the gpu's wanted to boot. We both thought that we just had to keep on booting. This was a big mistake. After this hugh struggle with the graphics cards the pc seemed to work and soon we were installing windows 10. Little did we know we would run into far more intricate issues that the gpu flaw. So after windows was installed we directly installed steam and downloaded a game. The gaming experience was terrible. Low frame rates an a lot of lag and a terrible responstime showed us that there was a lot of work to be done. After testing and trublleshooting a couple days went by without succes. Until we noticed that windows was only using one core efficiennly. We sented some e-mails to Intel, Asus, Micorsoft and nvidea. These support services gave us a lot of information and tried to fix the problem but none of them succeeded. After running out of solutions they also gave up. So we had nothing els to do accept Posted our questions one LinusTechTips forum. Again this also was a waste of time because eventhow the people on that forum are very helpful they could not find a solution. Eventialy we found it ourselfs, we disabled one core (the core that was seemingly slowing the rest down)  and all the others took it over. Now we had multiple cores but there was still one who was bottlenecking us. We decided to buy a new one on ebay. And...

					<h3>Coding</h3>
					<p>
						We wanted to share how we started at this project and how to put it all together. Making a website looked a very nice way to help people who want to do the same, but do not now where or how to start. We have a bit of experience with programming. So we decided to program it by ourselfs. We improved not only our soldering skills but also our programming skills. The coding itself doesn't took very long but the learning process took a while. But we are happy with the result so it's worth the effort.

					<h3>Decisions</h3>
					<p>
						We had to make some very difficult decisions, for example do we choose an Intel processor or an AMD. Intel has more quantity, but you see it at the price. AMD has more cores but is less faster and a bit cheaper. This chois changed the whole project, because we had to choose the motherboard and ram based on the procerssor.

					<h3>The Specifications</h3>
					<p>
						Many of our components came out of an older built. We just changed the ram, Gpu and Cpu to fit our need. Since we did not want to pay that much we decided to buy a Asus GTX 1050 ti. Gpu prices have skyrocketed since crypto mining so we still payed to much. But than agaian, the GTX 1050 ti is a very good price/ performance gpu and it was a much better card than what was in there before.
